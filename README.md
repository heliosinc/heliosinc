Basic Guidelines:
- Completed code goes in the 'Projects' folder under a project specific folder, e.g., 'Projects/Crypto Tracker'
- Snippets - useful pieces of code that we expect to use again - go in the 'Snippets' folder under a descriptive name, e.g., 'Snippets/Add data to MongoDB'
- All folders should inlcude a ReadMe file that includes the GPT summary about the project
